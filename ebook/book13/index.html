    <h1>Why Soup Kitchens are necessary in The Church</h1>
    <p>Since 1929, soup kitchens had spread through various churches and became very effective due to a growing depression. The soup kitchens had been started by churches and private charities to help out people in need.
In 1983, three ladies were intent on helping people in the United States that weren’t as fortunate as others. These three women’s names were Gwen James, Veronica Payne, and Bee Brown. They were very devoted and ended up managing a donated van. That was the start of their journey.
Word soon spread about a van being amid where people were handing out soup and sandwiches. Many people flocked to the three women and they were able to feed many mouths throughout the days. Later on, they were able to access a building and many other businesses provided materials and other needs to help reach the goals the three ladies had wanted to accomplish.
In that time, the three women had achieved so much. It inspired other churches around the community to come and help out. Many people were saved through these outreaches and helped in so many great ways.
Soup kitchens had spread out and many people were helping out the less fortunate and people that were desperate for help. It gave people hope. So many didn’t know where to turn to, or even where to go. But with the help of people, just like those three women, they did have somewhere to go after all. Food and other needs were provided and many people finally had hope. </p>
    <br>
    <p>That’s why soup kitchens are so impactful in this day and age. It’s giving people a ray of hope. To know that there are people who actually care about them and are eager to help them in their time of need.
 The most amazing example of these acts is in a place called, Boynton Beach Boulevard. Their soup kitchens are open 365 days a year and they are now serving 800 meals per day. So many churches and people around the globe are really being lights for people in a dark time. It’s a great example of the verse <strong>Matthew 25:35</strong> “For I was hungry and you gave me meat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took me in.”
There are so many ways for The Church to be a light, and this way has been just a sample of something so meaningful. </p>
