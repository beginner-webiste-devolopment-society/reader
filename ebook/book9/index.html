<h1>The History of Arthurdale</h1>
<p> I am going on a field trip. This field trip is about the city of Arthurdale, West Virginia. “The city was made by First
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as a project for the jobless miners
and others. It was one of the projects for the “Reedsville
project” it is in Preston County.  The town is also named
after Richard Arthur. The President once visited” the tour
guide explained as he showed us the blacksmith shop,
the old church, and many other old historic buildings
along with some ruins of an old factory that was used
during WWII and was destroyed due to it’s collapsing. It
dealt with furniture before it moved to the current
location of Superior Fibers. The new factory was a shoe,
and sink factory and is now a fiber glass filter plant.
