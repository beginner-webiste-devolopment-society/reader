    <h1>"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed." BY the US Constition the second amendment</h1>
    <h1> 5.56 NATO</h1>
    <p>The 5.56×45mm NATO (official NATO nomenclature 5.56 NATO, fyv-FYV-six) is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate cartridge family developed in the late 1970s in Belgium by FN Herstal.[5] It consists of the SS109, SS110, and SS111 cartridges. On 28 October 1980 under STANAG 4172 it was standardized as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.[6][7][5] Though they are not entirely identical, the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge family was derived from and is dimensionally similar to the .223 Remington cartridge designed by Remington Arms in the early 1960s.</p>
    <h1>.22lr</h1>
    <p>The 22 Long Rifle or simply 22 LR (metric designation: 5.6×15mmR) is a long-established variety of 22 caliber rimfire ammunition originating from the United States. It is used in a wide range of rifles, pistols, revolvers, smoothbore shotguns, and submachine guns. In terms of units sold it is by far the most common ammunition in the world today. Common uses include hunting and shooting sports. The 22 Long Rifle is effective at short ranges and has little recoil making it ideal for training.</p>
    <h1> 7.62x39</h1>
    <p>The 7.62×39mm (aka 7.62 Soviet or formerly .30 Russian Short)[5] round is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate cartridge of Soviet origin. The cartridge is widely used due to the worldwide proliferation of Russian SKS and AK-47 pattern rifles, as well as RPD and RPK light machine guns.
Shortly after World War II, the AK-47 was designed, later becoming the world's most widespread military-pattern rifle. The cartridge remained the Soviet standard until the 1970s. It was largely replaced in Soviet service by the 5.45×39mm cartridge, which was introduced with the new AK-74 rifle, and continues in service with the modernized current-issue Russian Armed Forces AK-74M service rifle, as well as the AK-12 rifle. In the 21st century the 7.62×39mm remains a common service rifle chambering, including for newly developed rifles like the AK-15.</p>
<h1>9x19 Parabellum</h1>
<p>The 9×19 mm Parabellum (also known as 9 mm Parabellum or 9 mm Luger) is a rimless, tapered firearms cartridge.

Originally designed by Austrian firearm designer Georg Luger in 1901,[6] it is widely considered the most popular handgun and submachine gun cartridge due to its low cost and extensive availability.[7][8][9] It is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as in many non-NATO countries.

Since the cartridge was designed for the Luger semi-automatic pistol, it has been given the designation of 9 mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI)[10] and the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP).[2]

A 2007 US survey concluded that "about 60 percent of the firearms in use by police are 9 mm [Parabellum]" and credited 9×19 mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers.[11]</p>
<h1>AR15 (rifle)</h1>
<p>The ArmaLite AR-15 is a select-fire, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed rifle manufactured in the United States between 1959 and 1964, and adopted by the United States Armed Forces as the M16 rifle. Designed by American gun manufacturer ArmaLite in 1956, it was based on its AR-10 rifle.</p>
