    <h1>Should Soup Kitchens Be Removed From Church Activities?:</h1>
<p><br><br>Why should soup kitchens not be a part of the church? Here are the following views. What is the main purpose of the church?
<br><br>They feed the hungry. However, they do not spiritually feed the God-depraved, sinners of the earth. Which there is no reason that soup kitchens should be in the church responsibilities. The mission of the church is to maintain the flock of God and to also save the lost.
<br><br>They sometimes clothe the poor and give them places to stay overnight. However, they do not give scriptures and save the heathen from their eternal damnation. That is better than before however, they are not doing all the work ascertained to them by God as His house.
<br><br>If we feed them physically but yet our main purpose which is to save the lost is not done then, <strong><em>John 6:35</em></strong> –(“And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”) what is the purpose of the church running the soup kitchen. Don’t Get me wrong feeding them physically is also good, but we should Glorify our father at the same time <strong><em>1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 10:31</em></strong> (“Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”) <br><br>
If we don’t correct the spiritually fatal mistake of forgetting to spread the Word Of Life, what good are we as Christians in operating a soup kitchen. <strong><em>1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 10:31</em></strong> (“Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”). <br><br>
