        <h2>-Tornadoes-</h2>
        <strong><p>Tornadoes are fast moving columns of air that are <br>
surrounded by hurricane force wind and precipitation <br>
(Hail, sleet, rain, snow). Ef5s are the ones that can level <br>
cities and cause BIG swaths of destruction. Ef4s cause <br>
less destruction but are more deadly due to their speed <br>
and because they are narrower and move with a <br>
faster wind speed. EF3-1s are weaker and therefore can <br>
be monitored inside the tornado by a special made car <br>
called the DOMINATOR by Reed Timmer, a well-known
meteorologist.<br>
The winds are caused by the moon’s gravitational <br>
pull along with the rotation of the earth. Wind is<br>
stationary air that earth rotates into.<br>
Now I know what you are thinking: if the tornadoes <br> are horizontal how do they get in the up and down position? <br> This is caused by strong down force winds.<br>
Tornadoes can level towns. On May 30, 2016<br>
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was nearly obliterated by an<br>
EF5 tornado I believe it killed 24 people and seven were
children.<br>
The El Reno tornado was another EF5; it killed<br>
several storm chasers and ripped the armor off a<br>
tornado-proof vehicle (DOMINATOR 1)<br>
Travelling in big trucks (semis) may be less risky than<br>
travelling in other vehicles because they are heavier and<br>
larger also because they are longer and lower to the
ground.<br>
The Moore, Oklahoma tornado changed from an EF5<br>
to an EF4 back to an EF5. Every storm chaser on the<br>
video that I saw about this storm lost their house in this
tornado.<br>
  Some people are asking how do the dominators<br>
withstand the force of the wind and pressure?<br>
  That is because they have specialized tank armor able to<br>
withstand 200mph winds. They are skirted with side<br>
armor and hydraulic spikes to keep the vehicle from<br>
being blown away or sucked up into the tornado.<br>
 However, it is not designed to withstand EF4-5s so if you<br>
happen to be in one of the dominators. DON’T GO AFTER
AN EF5!!<br>
