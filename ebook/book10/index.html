  <h1>  Earth Science: Tornadic Weather
    -Tornadoes-</h1>
  <p>  Tornadoes are fast moving columns of air that are
    surrounded by hurricane force wind and precipitation
    (Hail, sleet, rain, snow). Ef5s are the ones that can level
    cities and cause BIG swaths of destruction. Ef4s cause
    less destruction but are more deadly due to their speed
    and because they are narrower and move with a
    faster wind speed. EF3-1s are weaker and therefore can
    be monitored inside the tornado by a special made car
    called the DOMINATOR by Reed Timmer, a well-known
    meteorologist.
    The winds are caused by the moon’s gravitational
    pull along with the rotation of the earth. Wind is
    stationary air that earth rotates into.
    Now I know what you are thinking: if the tornadoes are horizontal how do they get in the up and down position? This is caused by strong down force winds.
    Tornadoes can level towns. On May 30, 2016
    Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was nearly obliterated by an
    EF5 tornado I believe it killed 24 people and seven were
    children.
    The El Reno tornado was another EF5; it killed
    several storm chasers and ripped the armor off a
    tornado-proof vehicle (DOMINATOR 1)
    Travelling in big trucks (semis) may be less risky than
    travelling in other vehicles because they are heavier and
    larger also because they are longer and lower to the
    ground.
    The Moore, Oklahoma tornado changed from an EF5
    to an EF4 back to an EF5. Every storm chaser on the
    video that I saw about this storm lost their house in this
    tornado.
      Some people are asking how do the dominators
    withstand the force of the wind and pressure?
      That is because they have specialized tank armor able to
    withstand 200mph winds. They are skirted with side
    armor and hydraulic spikes to keep the vehicle from
    being blown away or sucked up into the tornado.
     However, it is not designed to withstand EF4-5s so if you
    happen to be in one of the dominators. DON’T GO AFTER
    AN EF5!!
